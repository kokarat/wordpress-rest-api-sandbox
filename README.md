Wordpress Rest API Sandbox
==========================

Sandbox for trying Wordpress Rest API using JSON REST API plugin (with Python). They seem to be really easy if you see all the code here but it's actually hard if you get started by yourself :) Hope you enjoy!!

Installing step:
--
- The code/script can connect to Wordpress REST API with Wordpress site that install JSON REST API plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/)
- If your Wordpress site is multisite support, you can activate this plugin site by site if you don't want to activate it globally. It's working in both cases.



About the folders:
--
- simple_python_scripts is about many simple python scripts that make use of Wordpress REST API.
- Please also read README inside the folder to see the instruction.


Hint:
--
- Please install REST Console in Chrome browser and try your API first (GET/POST). It will make your life easier to figure out the code.
